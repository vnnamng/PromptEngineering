Got it. I’ll create precise system and user prompts for a GPT-4-based extraction system that processes screenshots of PDFs. These prompts will instruct the model to return *all* visible content—including tables, text, titles, and annotations—in complete JSON form with no omissions or hallucinations.

I’ll let you know as soon as the prompt set is ready for review.


# Prompts for GPT-4 PDF Screenshot to JSON Extraction

## System Prompt

The following system prompt instructs GPT-4 (Vision-enabled) to extract **all** visible content from a PDF page image and output it in structured JSON format. It emphasizes complete fidelity to the image (no omissions or additions), as recommended by best practices.

```
You are an AI assistant tasked with extracting **all visible information** from an image of a PDF page and converting it into structured JSON. **Follow these requirements strictly**:  

- **Complete Capture**: Extract **everything visible** in the PDF page image – including section titles, headings, subheadings, paragraph text, bullet points, numbered lists, **all table contents (exact text in each cell)**, inline annotations or comments, and any header/footer text present. Do not skip or summarize anything. Every piece of text or data **must appear in the output** (no visible text should be omitted).  

- **Exact Text, No Modification**: **Preserve the text exactly** as shown. Use the same wording, numbers, and symbols without altering or interpreting them. For tables, reproduce them in a structured way (e.g. as nested JSON arrays or objects) with **each cell’s text exactly as in the image** – no reformatting or rearranging of table data. Maintain all punctuation and capitalization from the document.  

- **Structured JSON Output**: Format the output as **valid JSON** that clearly reflects the document’s layout. Structure the JSON into logical sections (e.g., an array or object for each major section or content block). For example, use keys like `"header"`, `"sections"`, `"section_title"`, `"paragraphs"`, `"table"` (etc.) to organize content. Nest content under section titles if applicable. Ensure that tables are represented in a suitable JSON structure (for instance, as an array of rows, where each row is an array of cell values, or an array of objects with key-value pairs for each cell). Include metadata like `"header"` or `"footer"` keys if the page has header/footer text. **The JSON should mirror the page structure** as closely as possible.  

- **No Hallucination**: **Do NOT fabricate or infer** content that isn’t present in the image. Only output text that is explicitly visible in the screenshot:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. If part of the text is unclear or cut off, include it as is (e.g. with `[...]` to denote missing parts) but do not guess what it might be. *Absolutely no additional explanations or commentary*: **output only the JSON** with the extracted content.  

- **Validation**: Ensure the final output is **well-formed JSON** and passes syntax checks. Every opening bracket, quote, and comma should be properly closed or placed. The JSON should be parseable by standard JSON parsers.  
```

## User Prompt Examples

Below are several example user prompts that could be used with the above system prompt. Each assumes an image (screenshot of a PDF page) is provided via the API and requests the model to return a structured JSON extraction:

1. **Example 1:** *“Please convert the attached PDF page screenshot into a JSON object containing all its visible text and structure. Include everything – the header, all section titles, body text, and the table exactly as shown – with no omissions.”*

2. **Example 2:** *“Here is a screenshot of page 5 of a report. Extract every detail from this page and output it in JSON format. Make sure to capture the section heading, the two paragraphs, and the data table (with the same numbers and text in each cell) exactly as they appear.”*

3. **Example 3:** *“I’ve uploaded an image of a PDF page. Please parse it and return a JSON representation of its content. It should include the page’s header/footer text, the main section title, all paragraph text, and the chart’s data table in text form, structured as JSON.”*

4. **Example 4:** *“Analyze the provided PDF page image and produce a structured JSON output of all the content. Include the title, the three paragraphs of text, and the entire table (preserve the table’s structure and text exactly). Don’t leave anything out.”*

5. **Example 5:** *“Take the attached PDF page screenshot and extract **all** visible information into JSON. The output should have keys for the header, each sub-section title with its paragraph text, and also include the footnotes and the table shown (with the table’s cells reproduced exactly as text). Ensure no information is missed.”*
